- Male customers use bike rental services much more than female customers for short-distance trips.

Summary:
- Business owners should maintain a certain amount type of bikes for male users and keep a certain amount of bike inventories in south Manhattan stations.
- Bike inventory around the central park area is relatively lower than in the south station; however, since users are more likely to rent a bike for long-distance over 1 hour, the performance and stability of bikes should be relatively higher than the bike in the southern stations.
- Bike maintenance schedule should avoid business rush hours, and maintain bikes before 6:00 a.m. and after 9:00 p.m.
